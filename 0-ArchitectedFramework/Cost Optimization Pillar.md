#### Practice Cloud Financial Management
Managing cloud finance requires evolving your existing finance processes to establish and operate with cost transparency, control, planning, and optimization for your AWS environments.
ðŸ“ŒCloud Financial Management (CFM) allows finance, product, technology, and business organizations to manage, optimize, and plan costs as they grow their usage and scale on AWS. The primary goal of CFM is to allow customers to achieve their business outcomes in the most cost-efficient manner and accelerate economic and business value creation while finding the right balance between agility and control.
