# Cloud sustainability
ðŸ“ŒThe discipline of sustainability addresses the long-term environmental, economic, and societal impact of your business activities.
###### Emission Examples - Scope for AWS
- Scope 1
	- All direct emissions from the activities of an organization or under its control.
- Scope 2
	- Indirect emissions from electricity purchased and used to power data centers and other facilities.
- Scope 3
	- All other indirect emissions from the activities of an organization from sources it doesn't control.
###### The Shared Responsibility Model
![[sustain_shared.jpg]]
- AWS is responsible for optimizing the sustainability of the cloud â€“ delivering efficient, shared infrastructure, water stewardship, and sourcing renewable power.
- Customers are responsible for sustainability in the cloud â€“ optimizing workloads and resource utilization, and minimizing the total resources required to be deployed for your workloads.
###### Design principles for sustainability in the cloud
- Understand your impact
- Establish sustainability goals
- Maximize utilization
- Anticipate and adopt new, more efficient hardware and software offerings.
- Use managed services
- Reduce downstream impact of your cloud workloads.
#### Improvement Process
- To eliminate waste, low utilization, and idle or unused resources
- To maximize the value from resources you consume
1. Identify targets for improvement
2. Evaluate specific improvements
3. Prioritize and plan improvements
4. Test and validate improvements
5. Deploy changes to production
6. Measure results and replicate successes

	- [Part III: Networking](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/optimizing-your-aws-infrastructure-for-sustainability-part-iii-networking/)
#### Business metrics: Key Performance Indicators
![[sustain_kpi.jpg]]
Divide the provisioned resources by the business outcomes achieved to determine the provisioned resources per unit of work.
#### Sustainability as a non-functional requirement
Meeting sustainability targets might not require equivalent trade-offs in one or more other traditional metrics such as uptime, availability, or response time. You can achieve significant gains in sustainability with no measurable impact on service levels. Where minor trade-offs are required, the sustainability improvements gained by these trade-offs can outweigh the change in quality of service.
