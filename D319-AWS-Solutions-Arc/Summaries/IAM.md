### Identity Access Management
- Used to manage access to users and resources
- Free
- Root is the account initially created when an AWS account is set up.
- New IAM accounts have no permissions by default until granted.
- New users get assigned an Access Key ID and Secret when given programmatic access.
	- Access Keys
		- Only used for CLI and SDK
		- Only show once when created.
		- If lost must be deleted/recreated.
- Always set up MFA for root accounts.
- IAM Identities as Users, Groups, and Roles
	- Users: End users who log into the console or interact with AWS resources programmatically
	- Groups: to group up Users to share permission levels.
	- Roles: Associate permissions to a role and then assign to Users or Groups
- Policies: JSON documents which grant permissions for a user, group, or role to access services. Policies are attached to IAM Identities.
	- Managed Policies are provided by AWS and cannot be edited.
	- Customer Managed Policies are created by the customer, which can be edited.
	- Inline policies are directly attached to a user.
