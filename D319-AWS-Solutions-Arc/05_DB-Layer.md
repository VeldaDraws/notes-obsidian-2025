# Amazon DocumentDB (MongoDB)
![[icon_documentDB.jpg|50]]
Amazon #DocumentDB is a fully managed document, NoSQL database from AWS, that is full API compatible with MongoDB.
When you use Amazon DocumentDB, you begin by creating a cluster. A cluster consists of a cluster volume and instances: primary and replica.

| SQL         | Amazon Document DB |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| Table       | Collection         |
| Row         | Document           |
| Column      | Field              |
| Primary Key | Object ID          |

# DMS (Database Migration Service)
![[DMS.jpg]]
Migration Methods:
- **Homogenous data migration**
	- Migrate data with native database tools
- **Instance Replication**
	- Provision an instance with chosen instance type to perform the replications between databases
- **Serverless Replication**
	- a serverless offering where you pay as you go, with some limitations.
	- Does not have public IPs
	- Must user VPC endpoints to access specific AWS services.
	- Limited selection of possible sources and targets.
	- Doesn't support views with selection and transformation rules.
AWS DMS:
- Loads the tables with data without any foreign keys or constraints.
AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT):
- Identifies the issues, limitations and actions for the schema conversion.
- Generates the target schema scripts, including foreign keys and constraints.
- Converts code such as procedures and views from source to target and applies the code on the target.
