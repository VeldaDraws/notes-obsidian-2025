### Brief History
CIDR is a method for allocating IP addresses for IP routing. The Internet Engineering Task Force introduced CIDR in 1993 to replace the previous classful network addressing architecture on the internet. CIDR is based on VLSM: variable-length submasking (in which network prefixes have variable length).
