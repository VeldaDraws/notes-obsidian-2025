The AWS root user has two sets of credentials associated with it.
- email and password
- access keys (programmatic requests) in two parts:
	- access key ID
	- secret access key
ðŸ§¨ Don't create an access key for the root account unless you absolutely need to (rare and/or unheard of).
### Best Practices
The root user has complete access to all AWS services and resources in your account. Therefore you should **not*** use the root user for everyday tasks.
- Choose a strong password for the root user.
- Enable MFA
	- something you know
	- something you have
	- something you are
- Never share your root user password or access keys with anyone.
- Disable or delete the access keys associated with the root user.
- Create IAM user for administrative tasks or everyday tasks.
