Migration Strategy:
- You can choose a rehosting strategy to deploy to the cloud faster, with fewer data migration problems. Install your database engine software on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), migrate your data, and manage your database in a similar way to how you manage on premises. While rehosting is a fast path to the cloud, you're still left with the operational tasks such as upgrades, patches, backups, capacity planning and management, maintaining performance, and availability targets.
- AWS serverless offerings include Amazon Aurora Serverless, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon ElastiCache, Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra), Amazon Timestream for LiveAnalytics, and Amazon Neptune Serverless.
Characteristics:
- Data model needs.
- Data access methods.
- Extent to which needs to be real-time.
- Particular data record size.
