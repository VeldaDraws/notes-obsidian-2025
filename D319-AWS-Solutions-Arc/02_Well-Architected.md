##### Base Terminology:
- #component is the code, configuration, and AWS Resources that together deliver against a requirement.
- #workload is used to identify a set of components that together deliver business value
- #architecture as being how components work together in a workload
- Level of effort: categorizing the amount of time, effort, and complexity a task requires for implementation.
	- High: weeks or months; multiple stories, releases, tasks
	- Medium: days or weeks; multiple releases, tasks
	- Low: hours or days; multiple tasks
##### General Design Principles
- Stop guessing your capacity needs.
	- (If you make a poor capacity decision when deploying, you might end up sitting on expensive idle resources.)
- Test systems at production scale.
- Automate with architectural experimentation in mind.
- Consider evolutionary architectures.
	- Take advantage of innovations.
- Drive architectures using data.
- Improve through game days.
